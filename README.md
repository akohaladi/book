# Book

This is main source for the Roboscience text materials.

The document source is in the source directory.  You then need to run a make html to build the target sphinx web tree.  This creates a build directory and the web tree is contained within.  You will need the Anaconda distribution installed for the build.  

To build the html:   make html
To build the pdf:    make latexpdf
