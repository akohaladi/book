# Book

This is main source for the Roboscience text materials.

The document source is in the source directory.  You then need to run a make html to build the target sphinx web tree.  This creates a build directory and the web tree is contained within.  You will need the Anaconda distribution installed for the build.  

To build the html:   make html

To build the pdf:    make latexpdf

Our goal is to build a useful and modular curriculum.   So, instead of just forking the distro in silence, how about you contact us.  We might be able to add the content you want and end up with a better product overall.  We might also be able to setup for custom builds.  Thanks.
