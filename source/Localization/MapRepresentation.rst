Map Representation
------------------

.. Note:: This section under development.

The representation of the environment is reflected in the map. We have
discussed several methods earlier such as metric or continuous
descriptions, discrete or grid descriptions and topological
descriptions. Each choice has advantages and disadvantages.

Continuous descriptions can have high accuracy and lower data storage
requirements. The trade-off is the increased complexity of
representation of obstacles. Conversely discrete descriptions have high
storage requirements but reduced complexity of obstacle representation.
Discrete maps have limits on accuracy imposed by the basic grid cell
size. The precision of the map influences how precisely one can store
map features and is a factor in the computational complexity of the
algorithms using the map.
