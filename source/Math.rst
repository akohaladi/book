Mathematical and Computational Background
******************************************

Robotics, especially the controls literature, can be very mathematical
in nature. This text does not attempt to place the subject on a firm
mathematical foundation, but at times it is necessary to use the
mathematical formalism to avoid confusion. So, we jump in with some
common notation and then proceed to the standard vocabulary that all
robotics professionals use.

Mathematical Notation
---------------------

This text will use italicized letters for the variables in formulas:
:math:`x`. We will not distinguish scalar (single) variables from vector
(array) variables. Scalar and vector quantities will normally be lower
case (unless we need to be consistent with a well known formula). When
possible, elements of a vector will be indexed using a subscript
:math:`x_k`. Matrices will be indicated using italicized uppercase,
:math:`M`. Discrete time steps will be indicated by superscripts,
:math:`x^k`.
