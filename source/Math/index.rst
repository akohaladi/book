Mathematical and Computational Background

Robotics as an academic subject can be very mathematical in nature. This
text does not attempt to place the subject on a rigorous mathematical
foundation, but it is necessary to use the mathematical formalism to
avoid confusion. So, we jump in with some common notation and then
proceed to the standard vocabulary that all robotics professionals use.

Note: This is under significant development.
