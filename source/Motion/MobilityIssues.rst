Mobility Issues
---------------

The stability of the craft is given by several factors. Having less than
three contact points requires dynamic balance for a system which is “at
rest”. Having less than 6 contact points means that during locomotion,
the system requires dynamic balance during motion or one is moving at
most two legs at a time making a more complicated control system. The
location of the center of gravity is an important aspect of dynamic
stability. A lower center of gravity helps to avoid falling over.

For ground systems, the terrain will have more influence than with air
or sea. We have to worry about the terrain roughness, slickness, grades
and other issues. The number of wheels, type of wheels, type of
suspension, and steering will all have a large affect on the
effectiveness of motion.
