About this text
---------------

This is an electronic text to accompany a undergraduate university course in
robotics.   The lack of materials drove the creation of this work.

There are many issues to resolve with this book.   Many small ones and some
large ones.   The obvious problems relate to content, coverage, background and
other academic concerns.  Smaller ones relate to formatting, specific examples
and images.

Copyright concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This book came from course notes.  The notes were restricted
to class and as such subject to *Fair Use* guidelines.  Materials from the web
such as images were used as is.  Going to publication (either print or online)
brings a different set of rules.  We have gone to great effort to make sure that
all of the content is legally used.  Meaning that externally derived content is
in the public domain or has a "use with attribute" style license.

Conversion Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The original text was written in LaTeX.  We have converted over to restructuredText
using a fabulous tool called Pandoc.  Pandoc is good, but not perfect. We had
a very complicated latex document which Pandoc was not able to completely convert.
Although we have spent many hours with the conversion, there are aspects we
have missed.  The labels and references were a particular problem and many are
still broken.   Let us know about format problems (broken links, etc).

Document Content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a living document.  There are many sections of the original notes that need to be converted
over to to rst AND there are many sections that need to be written.  Robotics
is a active field with new technology daily.  New stuff needs to be written and
some old tools need to be updated.  We hope to get a bunch of this done by 9/1/18.

Robotics Education Community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our goal is to build an open source robotics education community.
