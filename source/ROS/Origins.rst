Player
~~~~~~

The beginnings of ROS date back to the Player project, which was founded
in 2000 by Brian Gerkey. This model included a hardware-abstracted
robotic system known as the player, which interfaced with its simulated
environment, known as the stage.

Switchyard
~~~~~~~~~~

The common API used by player was a major part of the next step on the
road to ROS, the Stanford project known as “Switchyard.” Switchyard was
developed by Morgan Quigley in 2007 under the Stanford Artificial
Intelligence Robot (STAIR) project. Development of the system was
shifted to a Stanford robotics start-up known as Willow Garage in 2008.
The platform matured for about 2 years, and in 2010, Willow Garage
released the first version of ROS.

OSRF
~~~~

In 2012, development of ROS began to shift from Willow Garage to the
newly formed OSRF also oversees development of the Gazebo robot
simulator, as well as the annual ROSCon, where ROS developers meet and
discuss various ROS-related topics. Development using ROS still
continues at Willow Garage, but the framework as a whole is developed at
OSRF.
