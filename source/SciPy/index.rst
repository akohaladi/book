Numerical Methods and SciPy
===========================

Note: This is under significant development.

The following material assumes that you are familiar with Python. Python
reads like pseudocode and so it is possible to follow along without a
background in Python if you have seen some other programming language. A
quick introduction is given in the Appendices for those who want to ramp
up before reading on.
