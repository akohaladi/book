Placing obstacles in Veranda
----------------------------

The last section has set the stage to enter obstacles in the simulator.
We will use the term *map* to refer to any file that defines the region and
the obstacles in the region.

Image files are used to generate maps.  Create a png formatted file that
contains the obstacles.   Leave open space white and paint the obstacles
black.  On the left side of the tool is the open map button.  Navigate to
the map file and open.  You will be able to set the threshold value for
free verses obstacle space, as well as the map dimensions.
