In this chapter we intoduce the simulation tool, Veranda, and cover
the basic elements to simulate robot motion.   Veranda is a two
dimensional simulator.  It was designed to have a low barrier to
entry and overall ease of use.  Veranda uses Box2D, a 2D physics
engine for more realistic interactions between objects.   It is not
intended for very high precision work (and does not support 3D).
For those applications, we suggest Gazebo (see appendix).
