.. Note:: **Draft**  - Feedback: Jeff McGough  jeff.mcgough@sdsmt.edu
   Most of the content is loaded.  The chapters on *Example Systems* and
   *System Integration* still need to be developed.  The *Computer Vision*
   and *Localization and Mapping* chapters need significant rework.  We will
   continue to update as material is added.  This will have the effect of
   changing page, equation and problem numbers.  Starting August 20th, we will
   have links to previous versions (html tree, html zip and pdf) for those
   teaching courses and need fixed numbering for the duration.
