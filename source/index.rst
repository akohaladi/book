.. Note:: **Draft**  - Feedback: Jeff McGough  jeff.mcgough@sdsmt.edu
   Most of the content is loaded.  The chapters on *Example Systems* and
   *System Integration* still need to be developed.  The *Computer Vision*
   and *Localization and Mapping* chapters need significant rework.  We will
   continue to update as material is added.   This material is currently
   used for CSC/CENG 415/515  Introduction to Robotics taught at the South Dakota
   School of Mines and Technology.  There is a slide deck for the course
   which roughly tracks this text (the text is ahead in edits and organization).
   When the current course ends, the slide deck will be made available as well.
   We are currently evaluating running this as an online course.  Thoughts
   on this are welcome.
