How would you define a robot?

What are the two main types of robots as presented by the text?

The text has broken robots into fixed or industrial manipulators and
mobile machines. Often the industrial manipulator is performing repeated
tasks or is remotely operated. Although many mobile systems are also
remotely operated, we don’t consider them doing repeated tasks.

Can you think of another way to classify robotic systems? What are the
strengths and weaknesses of the classification?

What problems does a mobile robot face that a stationary robot does not?
What about the other way around?

A stationary robot does not encounter new or novel environments. The
workspace for a stationary robot is relatively fixed. It’s tasks are
predetermined for the most part. A mobile robot constantly moves into
new environments. Even if the task is to be repeated, in a new
environment the details of performing the task will be different.

What are the differences between robots that are considered Mobile
Machines and those that are considered to be Manufacturing Machines?

Do you think the *Robotic Appliance* and *Robotic Agent* partitioning is
a more effective way to classify robots? Why or why not?

List several approaches that industry has used so robots can navigate in
an environment; mentioning an advantage and disadvantage of each.

Describe the information gathered by a RGBD sensor such as the Microsoft
Kinect.

Describe the information gathered by a stereo camera pair.

List out different ways one could assist a robot in navigating around a
building or inside a building when GPS is not an option. [Think
sensors.]

What is an FPGA? What is a GPU? What is a TPU? What are their strengths
and weaknesses compared to traditional CPUs?

What are Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics? What do they mean? Are
they complete, meaning are they a sufficient set of rules?

Work in robotics can replace people with machines. This results in job
loss. Discuss the ethics of working in the robotics industry.

Military robotics is a growing industry. Although many systems have a
high degree of autonomy, use of deadly force is left for the human.
Discuss the ethical issues in allowing the robot to make these
decisions.

If an autonomous system by design or error causes an accident, who is
liable?

List a few ways biology has inspired robotics.
