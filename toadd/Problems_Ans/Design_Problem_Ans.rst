What are the pros and cons to sharing address space?

How does a system call differ from a function call?

How can a message passing system be used to coordinate two processes?
Show a pseudo-code example.

What are some pros and cons with centralized server architectures for
coordinating multiprocess communication?

Many industrial systems have fences or cages that contain the robot
which prevents human-robot collisions. The cage system is designed to
shut power if the cage door is open. Some of these systems have a key
and lock that prevents restarting. This has been defeated by a worker
closing the cage door after entry, not taking the key and another worker
by accident powering up the robot. Describe some additions to this
system which could prevent this breach of safe operation.

Name two very simple things that can be done to make industrial robots
safer.

List some periods of robot operation that are very risky for humans.
What can be done to mitigate the risk?

What needs to be addressed for humans to comfortably work with robots?

What is the cause of uncanny valley?

Provide an example not in the text of an exploit of a robotics system.

   The term security has become associated with preventing system
   cracking but secure really means that you can trust the system. You
   may not care about intrusion or data exposure, but you do care that
   the system operates the way you need it to.

   There are roughly 1.7 million trucking jobs in the U.S.

   The fallacy is that new technology eliminates jobs overall. New tech
   just displaces jobs to new sectors.
