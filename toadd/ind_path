If the mixed partial approach is not working out,
we can borrow the concepts of independence of path and
conservative vector fields from calculus.
Equation :eq:`eq:differential` is related to the
differential form you studied in line integrals.

.. math::
   :label:  eq:differentialform

   df = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i (x,t) d x_i + a_t(x,t) dt .

To be a holonomic constraint, we need that
Equation :eq:`eq:differentialform` to be a total
derivative (exact differential) or that by using an integrating factor
can be made into a total derivative (exact differential). If you are
able to convert an expression to the form in
Equation :eq:`eq:holonomicdefn` then we know that we
have a holonomic constraint.

Maybe the expression is not holonomic or you just don’t see how to
integrate it. Recall that this is related to the independence of path
concept from calculus. There you could integrate over different paths
(same start and end points). If the values differed, then you did not
have independence of path meaning you did not have an exact differential
(stated in Calculus as lacking a potential function). Let :math:`C_1`
and :math:`C_2` be two parameterizations of two different paths with the
same starting and ending points. Then if the path integrals differ:

.. math:: \int_{C_1} F \neq \int_{C_2} F

the expression (constraint) does not have a holonomic representation.

**Example:** Which of the following are holonomic?


#. The constraint :math:`x_1 \dot{x}_1 + \dot{x}_1 \dot{x}_2 = 0`? We
   see that the velocity terms are not expressed linearly so this is not
   non-holonomic. We illustrate the idea of integrating over two paths
   to show how that idea works. Define :math:`C_1` to the the path from
   (0,0) to (1,1) via :math:`x_1(t)=t`, :math:`x_2(t)=t`,
   :math:`0\leq t \leq 1`. Define :math:`C_2` to be the path
   :math:`x_1(t)=t`, :math:`x_2(t)=0`, :math:`0\leq t \leq 1` plus
   :math:`x_1(t)=1`, :math:`x_2(t) = t`, :math:`0\leq t \leq 1`. The
   line integral of the constraint
   :math:`F = x_1 \dot{x}_1 + \dot{x}_1 \dot{x}_2` over the two paths
   gives

   .. math:: \int_{C_1} F \neq \int_{C_2} F

   which implies the constraint cannot be an exact derivative of some
   potential. This confirms that the constraint is not holonomic.


#. The constraint :math:`(x_1 + x_2 )\dot{x}_1 + (2x_1)\dot{x}_2= 0`.
   This is linear. Using the same paths as the example 2, the line
   integral of the constraint
   :math:`F = (x_1 + x_2 )\dot{x}_1 + (2x_1)\dot{x}_2` over the two
   paths gives

   .. math:: \int_{C_1} F \neq \int_{C_2} F.

   Thus this is not holonomic.
